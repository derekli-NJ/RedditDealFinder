## About
This is a Reddit Bot that sends the most recent posts from the subreddit FrugalMaleFashion to the user's inbox. Each message contains the title of the post and link to the post.

You can schedule this script to run everyday using crontab on Mac. Here is a tutorial: https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/schedule-jobs-with-crontab-on-mac-osx.html.

Also, this bot can be edited to send this information from any subreddit with just a few minor tweaks.

All the best and feel free to message me any questions at derekli2@illinois.edu!

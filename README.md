# RedditDealFinder

This is a Reddit Bot that sends the most recent posts from the subreddit FrugalMaleFashion to the user's inbox. Each message contains the title of the post and link to the post.

Also, this bot can be edited to send this information from any subreddit with just a few minor tweaks.

All the best and feel free to message me any questions at derekli2@illinois.edu!

## Setup
1. Register your Reddit account and get a client_id and client_password. More info on this can be found here: https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/oauth2
2. Press run and the script will continously parse the subreddit that is set and send you messages to your inbox.
3. You can schedule this script to run everyday using crontab on Mac. Here is a tutorial: https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/schedule-jobs-with-crontab-on-mac-osx.html.
